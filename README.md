# UI-KIT

Stoplight ui-kit is a shared component library that contains basic components built using styled-components. All components should support overridable theming from a theme object, and also come with default styling from our prepackaged theme.

## Getting Started

Check out the `package.json` scripts property for all commands. Yarn must be installed before running these commands.

```
# run initial setup
yarn setup

# start the storybook server
yarn storybook
```
